# compact_genetic_algorithm_for_one_max
Simple compact genetic algorithm for solving one max problem.

The code is designed for understanding the generic algorithm.
We choose one max problem because it is a simple problem to make your first time of codiing a genetic algorithm.
The solution of the one max problem is all of bits are one.

command line for running a genetic algorihm to solve the problem. The <NUM_BITS> is an argument for specific the problem size which is a number of bits.
> python ./one_max.py <NUM_BITS>

run a genetic algorithm with one max 8 bits problem.

> python ./one_max.py 8
